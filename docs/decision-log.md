# Decision Log — Phase 0

**Meeting:** partner session, 18 October 2026 (founder + AI chair)
**Attendees:** Siim Liimand (founder)
**Rule:** every decision has an owner and a deadline. Revisions only via the sanctioned checkpoints noted per decision.

| # | Decision | Choice | Owner | Deadline / checkpoint |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pilot segment | **Interior fit-out, Tallinn + Harju County, 6 trades** (electrical, plumbing, HVAC, drywall, flooring, painting). Liquidity-first: density over coverage. Expansion to other clusters/regions only in Phase 4 via the same playbook. | Founder | Locked; segment changes only via Gate 1 pivot criterion |
| 2 | Booking system | **Build fully ourselves** on D1 (capacity per skill per day, holds behind flag, first-confirmed-wins at DB level, email fallback). Generic calendar sync stays deferred to Phase 4. Cloudflare-only constraint intact. | Engineering (founder + AI) | Build in Phase 2 wks 7; calendar decision revisited Phase 4 |
| 3 | MVP scope | **Confirmed the §7 in/out table, with one change: multi-trade requests are IN.** Consequences: Request model needs a required-trades set (migration on cockpit schema), matching/outreach per trade, comparison view grouped by trade. P0 + AI brief builder + comparison view. One-trade-per-request limitation dropped. | Engineering | Scope frozen; changes only at phase gates |
| 4 | Team & budget | **Solo founder + AI-assisted build. Bootstrapped** (founder time + Cloudflare paid plan + register fees until Gate 2). Founder wears product, research, supply, ops, legal. Interviews and recruitment are the critical path, not code. Gate calendar stretches right; sequence and kill criteria unchanged. | Founder | Spend reviews at Phase 1 and Phase 3 checkpoints |
| 5 | Company & legal | **Pilot runs under the existing OÜ** (Rajahinta). Separate entity only if partners join / Gate 3 passes. **ToS + GDPR/privacy checklist drafted immediately** (AI, for founder review); **professional lawyer review before the first real provider data is collected.** Worker names/schedules are personal data. | Founder (drafts: AI) | Drafts within 1 week; lawyer review before pilot data collection |
| 6 | Success criteria | **Pilot targets + kill/pivot criteria confirmed as provisional** (plan.md §9, details/08). North star: % of eligible requests reaching a useful confirmed outcome within acceptable time. **Single sanctioned revision: day-30 synthesis.** Kill discipline pre-committed: G1 <4/10 + no provider interest → stop; G2 <50% qualified even manually → stop; G3 repeat <25% + effort not declining → stop/pivot. | Founder | Revision window: day-30 synthesis only |

## Why narrow segment (recorded rationale for Decision 1)

Marketplaces die from thinness, not missing coverage. Construction availability is local
(trades × radius), so breadth dilutes match rate per recruited provider. Early trust forms
on the first request; a zero-match request loses the PM permanently. Estonia is compact —
post-pilot expansion is incremental, and retrenchment from "failed everywhere" is impossible.

## Open items created by this meeting

- Multi-trade request model → engineering design before Phase 2 build (fits cockpit schema evolution)
- ToS + GDPR checklist + data-processing register → drafted task (0.2)
- Register research findings → gates badges + profile pre-seeding (0.3)
- Day-30 synthesis meeting → sole revision point for targets (Decision 6)
